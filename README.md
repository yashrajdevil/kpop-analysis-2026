# OffScript Studio – Cultural Analysis Platform

OffScript Studio, an independent cultural analysis platform, has officially launched with a focus on the economics, labor systems, and transnational impact of global pop culture, beginning with in-depth research on the K-pop industry.

Founded by independent analyst **Yash Kurhe**, OffScript Studio publishes long-form investigations that examine the structures behind entertainment industries—ranging from trainee labor economics and idol debt to global fandom dynamics and cultural exchange between Asia, Latin America, and the West.

The platform’s launch coincides with the release of its first major research publication, **“The K-Pop Trainee Economy: $7.5M Debut Costs and Idol Debt”**, a data-driven analysis exploring how modern K-pop agencies operate trainee systems comparable to high-risk venture capital models. The report synthesizes publicly available financial filings, legal developments, and firsthand accounts from former trainees and industry staff.

Unlike traditional entertainment media, OffScript Studio positions itself at the intersection of cultural studies, industry analysis, and public education. Its articles are written for global readers, combining accessible language with rigorous sourcing to support journalists, researchers, and fans seeking a deeper understanding of how pop culture systems actually function.

> “In recent years, global audiences have become more skeptical of polished narratives,” said Kurhe. “There’s growing demand for transparency around labor, economics, and power structures in entertainment. OffScript Studio exists to meet that demand without sensationalism.”

The platform also reflects a broader shift in how cultural analysis is consumed in 2026, as readers increasingly seek independent voices outside legacy media and corporate entertainment reporting.

**OffScript Studio’s research and essays are available publicly at:**

Future publications will expand into topics including global fandom economies, AI’s impact on creative labor, and the financial mechanics behind international pop culture exports.
